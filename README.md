# Official Lip Registry

This is the repository for the official Lip Registry (<https://registry.litebds.com>). It contains the index of common Lip packages, e.g. `liteloaderbds`, `llanticheat`, `lip`, etc.

For Lip users, you do not need to do any configuration. Just run `lip install <alias>` and Lip will automatically fetch the package from the official registry. For example, `lip install lip` will install the latest version of Lip.

For tooth creators, you can refer to [this guide](https://lip.docs.litebds.com/en/#/tutorials/submit_your_tooth_to_lip_registry) to submit your tooth to the official registry. Currently, we only accept teeth that are hosted on GitHub.

If you discover any problems with the registry, or if you find that some teeth are deprecated or failed to install, please [open an issue](https://github.com/LiteLDev/Registry/issues/new/choose).
